~~~``` SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a programming language used to communicate with relational databases.

~~~``` The acronym is pronounced like the word sequel, but some people will just use the three letters S, Q, and L.

~~~``` Although there were precursors to the SQL language as early as the 1960s, relational databases didnâ€™t hit the market until the 1980s.

~~~``` In 1979, Oracle became the first to incorporate an SQL language into its relational database construct.

~~~``` SQL does have its distracters who consider it to be too slow and lacks the eloquence of other programming languages.

~~~``` Despite its critics, SQL has become the standard language for querying and manipulating data stored in a relational database.
