Habiganj formerly known as Habibganj, which was named after its founder Syed Habib Ullah of Taraf Kingdom, is a district of the Sylhet Division in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh. Between the thirteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Habiganj was part of the state of Nasirabad, now called Mymensingh. At present, it is a district of Sylhet Division.

With the passage of time, Habibganj turned into Habiganj. During the British Raj, Habiganj was established as a Thana (police precinct) in 1790, under Dhaka district (1779â€“1793). Until 1896, Habiganj's administrative centre was in Court Andar, Laskarpur. On 12 September 1874 it came under Sylhet district (part of Assam). Habiganj was declared as subdivision in 1867. On 7 April 1893, according to Notification #273 of Assam Provincial Government, Habiganj Thana (Administrative unit) was established. Habiganj was rejoined with East-Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1911. Then the Office of the Circle Officer (Development) was established in 1960. On 1 March 1984 Habiganj was established as a District. Md. Kamrul Hasan is the Deputy Commissioner.
