				^__What is a function? __^

	Groups of classes are called a function. A function requires specific classes. For example,
	if you want to create a function to play songs then you need to create specific classes under
	these programs in which play, pause, stop and etc. are the classes. Now in a marriage example,
	the Shanti program contains various functions such as mama swagat, batna lepan, lok sangit, sehra
	bandi are various functions inside the Shanti program. Thatâ€™s why small and big functions are important
	in a programming language to create software.
